Chaturaji - The Ancient Four-Player Game of India
A faithful digital recreation of Chaturaji, the ancient four-player chess-like game from India. This project brings the historical game to modern web browsers, implemented with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
üìú About The Game
Chaturaji, meaning "four kings," is a strategic dice-based board game that is an ancestor to modern chess. Unlike the two-player game we know today, Chaturaji is a chaotic and exciting battle between four armies, each positioned at a corner of the board. Alliances can be formed and broken in an instant, and victory depends on both skillful strategy and the luck of the dice.
This project aims to preserve and share this fascinating piece of board game history by providing an accessible, playable version for everyone.
